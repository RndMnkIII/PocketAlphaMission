# SNK ASO/Alpha Mission Compatible Gateware IP Core

Follow any core updates and news on my Twitter acount [@RndMnkIII](https://twitter.com/RndMnkIII). this project is a hobby but it requires investing in arcade game boards and specific tools, so any donation is welcome: [https://ko-fi.com/rndmnkiii](https://ko-fi.com/rndmnkiii).

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

This core originated from the core project for __SNK's__ __Alpha__ __Mission__ arcade game. Encompass the __"SNK Triple Z80"__ platform, this groups together several games that were developed by SNK around the mid-1980s using a similar hardware architecture. For a complete reference of the list of games consult
[https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/snk/snk.cpp](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/snk/snk.cpp).

## üß© Game strategy
{| {{prettytable}}
| width=50% | [[File:ASO Armor Octo.png|left]] The '''Octo Armor''' provides the Syd with 8-way simultaneous laser fire. It's energy consumption is strictly by time. Whether you fire the lasers or not, the Octo Armor will drain energy at a slow pace.
| width=50% | [[File:ASO Armor Shield.png|right]] The '''Shield Armor''' is the most defensive armor available to the Syd. It protects the Syd with a circular barrier that will absorb damage at the cost of it's energy (two bars of energy per hit, half the rate of all other armors.) You can recharge the Shield by collecting more energy tiles.
|-
|[[File:ASO Armor Cannon.png|left]] The '''Cannon Armor''' gives the Syd access to six simultaneous laser shots all in a row, providing ultimate forward destructive power which travels very quickly. Energy consumption for the Cannon is time based, slowly draining energy whether the cannon is fired or not.
|[[File:ASO Armor Homing.png|right]] The '''Homing Armor''' upgrades the power of the Syd's missile launchers. They will fire two glowing orbs which, over a short period of time, divide into six orbs and follow a prescribed path until they get close enough to a ground target to be attracted to it and destroy it. Energy consumption for the Homing Armor is per homing missiles fired. Do not blindly hold the missile button down or you will expend the armor quickly.
|-
|[[File:ASO Armor Paralyzer.png|left]] The '''Paralyzer Armor''' send a column of energy immediately in front of the Syd. Any enemy hit by this column becomes frozen in place, and shatters a few seconds later. The column of energy can also be used to cancel the bullets of enemy fire. The Paralyzer drains energy twice as fast as most weapon armors, as it is constantly active and cannot be turned off. This armor is great for stages with heavy enemy activity, but terrible against most boss fights.
|[[File:ASO Armor Nuclear.png|right]] The '''Nuclear Armor''' is another armor that upgrades the Syd's missile launchers. They will fire a single bomb which travels a certain distance forward and explodes whenever it hits a ground target, or reaches it's maximum travel distance. The explosion is immense, attacking even aerial targets, but the energy cost is high: 3 units of energy per missile. This makes it less practical for typical stage scenarios, but excellent for many boss fights.
|-
|[[File:ASO Armor Fire.png|left]] The '''Fire Armor''' sends out a column of energy much like the Paralyzer armor, only in this case, it is a column of fire. While the Fire armor is active, you will be unable to shoot your regular lasers of missiles, but the column of fire will destroy every object it touches, whether on the ground or in the air, and it will even destroy enemy bullets. Fire Armor drains energy twice as fast as other typical weapon armors.
|[[File:ASO Armor Thunder.png|right]] The '''Thunder Armor''' is the most powerful offensive armor. When the missile button is pressed, the Syd travels to the center of the screen, and unleashes a web of lightning that destroys every enemy present on the screen at that time. The cost is very high for this armor, 8 units of energy per use (although you may still fire one last thunder if you have less than 8 units). Since you can't fire missiles with this armor, it is also the only method that you have of revealing and collecting tiles. This armor is best saved for boss fights.
